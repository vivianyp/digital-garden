# Reflection - Navigating Liminal Space as a Clinician-Researcher

As I prepare for my PhD written exams and reflect on my journey as a genetic counselor pursuing a PhD in health informatics, I find myself in a liminal space—that threshold between distinct states of being where I am neither here nor there, floating in a disorienting yet infinitely exciting space of possibility. A liminal space, derived from the Latin "limen" meaning threshold, describes that metaphysical place between two distinct points where the future feels endless because it isn't firm yet. This fluid, mixed space feels simultaneously uncomfortable and thrilling.

While I hold multiple intersectional identities, this liminal space feels different from those more established aspects of myself. Where intersectionality suggests concrete, identifiable positions at the crossing of defined categories, this liminal experience feels more fluid and uncertain—perhaps this is the  process of forming a new intersectional identity as a "clinician-researcher" that I don't yet feel fully ready to claim.

## Navigating Methodological Tensions

Throughout my doctoral coursework, I've loved both my applied courses—learning about coding, project management, EHR systems, and interprofessional collaboration—and my more theory-based research courses focused on systematic reviews, study design, human factors theoretical frameworks, and statistical rigor. Each set of courses felt valuable and engaging, but I felt caught between them in a way I couldn't quite articulate. The applied courses expanded my understanding of 'how healthcare works' (though as a clinician, I already lived much of this reality daily), while the research methodology courses taught me 'how to study things rigorously,' and there was this persistent sense of being pulled between different ways of approaching knowledge.

This disconnect might reflect a deeper tension in health informatics research between internal and external validity. Traditional biomedical research emphasizes internal validity—randomized controlled trials, careful control of confounders, statistical power calculations. But much of health informatics research, particularly usability studies, prioritizes external validity and real-world applicability over experimental control. I find myself questioning usability studies that rely on eight participants and think-aloud protocols as methodologically "sloppy" compared to RCT standards, yet I also recognize that RCTs, with their emphasis on controlled conditions, may miss the very contextual factors that determine whether health technologies succeed or fail in practice.

The critical insight that has helped me navigate this tension is that in health informatics, the context IS the intervention. We're studying sociotechnical systems where it's not just "does this drug work?" but "does this technology work for these users in this organizational context with these workflows and competing priorities?" Similarly, in genetic counseling research, it's not just "does this genetic test provide accurate results?" but "does this testing approach work for these patients in this clinic setting with these communication styles and these family dynamics?" This perspective becomes particularly crucial when considering health equity and access to genetic services—understanding not just whether genetic counseling is effective, but how cultural contexts, language barriers, healthcare systems structures, and social determinants of health shape who can access these services and how they experience them. This realization has fostered a newfound appreciation for systems thinking and complexity that I hadn't fully grasped before. It's helped me understand that my applied knowledge serves as the foundation that allows me to see research opportunities others might miss. Understanding interprofessional dynamics helps me design better studies of AI adoption. Knowing the complexities of clinical workflows helps me identify implementation barriers that pure methodologists might overlook.

## Living with Impostor Syndrome

This growing methodological sophistication has created a particularly acute form of impostor syndrome that manifests differently depending on context. I'm worried about looking presumptuous when I critique existing methods, but I also don't feel confident enough in my own methodological skills to propose better alternatives. I can identify tensions and ask probing questions about research approaches, but I don't yet have the execution skills to design the sophisticated studies I now understand we might need.

In genetic counseling settings, colleagues look to me as an experienced clinician and potential mentor. I can see opportunities to bring more rigorous research approaches to questions our field has been asking, but I feel like I'm still learning the methodological skills that would allow me to lead such efforts. I have insights about what we might be missing but lack the confidence to assert methodological authority.

In academic settings, I'm learning alongside students who may have stronger methodological training but lack clinical context. I can see how their proposed studies might fail in real-world implementation, but I'm still developing the research skills they take for granted. The impostor syndrome here manifests as a double bind: simultaneously feeling "who am I to explain this to you?" while also worrying that "I am not doing it justice to explain it well." I'm always translating between the different types of knowledge I bring and the different types I'm still acquiring, but the explaining feels fraught—both presumptuous and inadequate.

## Embracing Endless Possibility

Gradually, I'm beginning to see that this liminal position offers something unique—the disorienting yet thrilling experience of existing in a space where the future feels genuinely open. Rather than viewing myself as awkwardly positioned between established categories, I'm starting to understand that I'm occupying a new space entirely, one that's fluid and still forming.

This liminal space is simultaneously uncomfortable and infinitely exciting precisely because it isn't firm yet. I don't have to choose between being a clinician or a researcher, between applied knowledge and methodological rigor, between practical relevance and scientific sophistication. Instead, I get to explore what it means to exist authentically in the threshold space where these different ways of knowing intersect and inform each other.

I'm learning to embrace this liminal space rather than rushing to escape it. The disorientation of floating between established categories may be exactly what allows for genuine innovation. Instead of waiting until I've "figured it out" to contribute, I'm beginning to see that the translation work I can do now—while actively learning and questioning—might be exactly what multiple fields need.

My goal is becoming clearer: I want to develop the methodological sophistication to design studies that are both rigorously scientific and practically meaningful. I want to become the kind of researcher who can navigate the tensions between different ways of knowing, who can bring clinical wisdom to research design and research rigor to clinical questions.

This requires accepting that I may continue to feel like I'm explaining myself across different contexts—translating clinical insights for methodologists and methodological possibilities for clinicians. But perhaps that's exactly the work that needs to be done. The goal isn't to resolve the tensions between different ways of knowing, but to exist authentically in the threshold space where they meet and to help others navigate those connections.

In embracing this liminal space, I'm not just finding my research identity—I'm potentially helping to create new ways of thinking about the relationship between rigorous science and practical application. The future feels endless because it isn't firm yet, and that's exactly what makes this threshold space so thrilling to inhabit.
