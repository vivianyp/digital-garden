# Welcome to My Digital Garden

I'm Vivian Pan, a genetic counselor pursuing a PhD in health informatics at the University of Illinois Chicago. I've spent over a decade working at the intersection of clinical practice and research, trying to figure out how to make genetic services more accessible and equitable—especially for communities that have been historically underserved.

Currently, I'm working at the University of Illinois Cancer Center to integrate genetic services into primary care at federally qualified health centers. These days, I'm particularly fascinated by how emerging technologies like AI might transform (or complicate) the way we deliver genetic counseling.

I serve as Secretary/Treasurer for the American Board of Genetic Counseling and Associate Editor for the Journal of Genetic Counseling, but what really drives me is the day-to-day work of bridging the gap between rigorous research methodology and the messy, wonderful reality of clinical practice.

This digital garden is where I'm exploring the questions and tensions that arise when you're trying to exist authentically between different ways of knowing—as a clinician, researcher, and everything in between.
